# Mask-and-Nomask
This project presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for mask detection in facial images. The goal of this model is to distinguish people wearing masks from those without masks with high accuracy and reasonable speed. This system can be used in applications such as smart surveillance, public access control, and security systems.
